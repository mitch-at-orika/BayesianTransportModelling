# BayesianTransportModelling

Welcome to the repo to the repo that will hopefully facilitate progress and discussion in the application of probabilistic programming to transport and traffic modelling problems.

Transport Modelling is a field of study that uses forecasting and prediction extensively and liberally. I still believe in it, because some information is better than none but I feel the industry is due for an introduction to Bayesian methods. I see it having significant benefits for the transport modelling field.

# Structure

This library will heavily leverage methods established in the text book - Statistical Rethinking (Second Edition) and the port of the source code to Numpyro. Essentially the repo will contain toy example implimentations of transport modelling problems and progressively build up a library of helper classes/functions. 

# Benefits of bayesian methods

Anticipated benefits of bayesian methods includes: supporting structured human reasoning, python syntax, natural uncertainty quantification, pooling / shrikage for data with varying sample sizes over index variables etc
