# Bayesian Version of Trip Gen

Unfortunetely the stats model code is reproduceable here but I am not publishing the code for doing all the data wrangling because this repository is not the place.

Hopefully this code inspires new discussion and thinking in the space of transport demand model estimation!

I have split the estimation into two seperate methods one for the easier purposes and one for the trickier ones.

Feedback and comments definetely welcome - I don't claim to know it all. I am not a statistician but bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming facinates me and I will keep learning.
